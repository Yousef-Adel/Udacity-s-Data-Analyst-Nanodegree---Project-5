# Udacity-s-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree---Project-5

The 6th Project for Data Analyst Nano Degree (Communicating Data Findings)

My dataset for this project is From Kaggla (https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new)
This dataset meets the requirements as illustrated bellow

Context
YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. According to Variety magazine, “To determine the year’s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). Note that they’re not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year”. Top performers on the YouTube trending list are music videos (such as the famously virile “Gangam Style”), celebrity and/or reality TV performances, and the random dude-with-a-camera viral videos that YouTube is well-known for.
