# Udacity-s-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree---Project-5

The 6th Project for Data Analyst Nano Degree (Communicating Data Findings)

My dataset for this project is From Kaggla (https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new)
This dataset meets the requirements as illustrated bellow

Context
YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. According to Variety magazine, “To determine the year’s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). Note that they’re not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year”. Top performers on the YouTube trending list are music videos (such as the famously virile “Gangam Style”), celebrity and/or reality TV performances, and the random dude-with-a-camera viral videos that YouTube is well-known for.

## Key Insights for Presentation

There is a strong correlation between these four numerical variables (like, dislike, views, comment count). Except for likes and dislikes with each other, it becomes a weaker correlation. Surprisingly there is a strong correlation between views and dislike even you can get famous by doing something people hate. Most videos are in the entertainment category, which makes sense that the highest views are for the same category. The trendiest channel is ChildishGambinoVEVO, and is also categorized as entertainment content. The lowest category in the number of videos is Nonprofit, and activism which is an indicator YouTube platform is for entertainment for the most.
